# 🖥 All-in-One Compiler

🚀 A web-based compiler and coding practice platform that brings together everything you need to learn and practice coding — all in one place. 

Unlike basic compilers, this project not only supports multiple programming languages but also comes with advanced features such as coding question generation, database storage, progress tracking, and a personalized dashboard. 

It’s more than just a compiler — it’s a complete coding assistant designed to make coding accessible, interactive, and effective.

## ✨ Features

### 🖊 Compiler (All Standard Features)
- Supports multiple languages: C, C++, Java, Python, JavaScript, and more. 
- Syntax highlighting and editor-like environment. 
- Custom input support (stdin). 
- Real-time output display for code execution. 
- Error handling with clear compiler/runtime error messages. 
- Multiple test cases support (run code against hidden/public test cases). 
- Fast and lightweight execution directly in your browser. 

### 📚 Coding Question Generator
- Automatically generates unique coding questions for practice. 
- Questions are stored in the database only if they don’t already exist (avoiding duplicates). 
- Categorized by difficulty levels: Easy, Medium, Hard. 
- Covers a wide range of topics: arrays, strings, recursion, dynamic programming, etc. 

### 📊 Progress Tracking & Dashboard
- Track your journey: number of questions solved, attempted, and skipped. 
- Performance metrics: accuracy, success rate, coding streaks. 
- Visual dashboard with charts and analytics. 
- Helps users identify weak areas and improve gradually. 

### 🧪 Test Case Evaluation
- Submissions are validated against multiple test cases. 
- Instant feedback on correctness, runtime, and efficiency. 
- Encourages writing clean and optimized code. 

### 🌍 Accessibility
- Runs directly in the browser — no heavy IDE or setup required. 
- Works on all major operating systems and devices. 
- Lightweight, responsive, and user-friendly UI. 

### 🤝 Open-source & Community-driven
- Built for learners, by learners. 
- Community contributions are welcome.
